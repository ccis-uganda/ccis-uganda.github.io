The current and previous releases of ODK-X (formerly ODK 2) tools are hosted on GitHub in each tool's repository.

The tools are generally updated every three to four months, so stay up to date by watching the [releases](https://forum.odk-x.org/c/releases) category on the forum.

## [ODK-X Tables](#odk-x-tables)
A mobile data curation Android app that  allows users to visualize and update existing data.
Tables also enables web developers to build powerful data management applications to handle their complex workflows. Tables gives you the flexibility to implement your own arbitrary complex workflow. For example you might collect data via a customized mapping interface: Tables allows you to build an application using web technologies to achieve that.

## [ODK-X Survey](#odk-x-survey)
A question based data collection Android app that uses a predefined survey specified using the XLSXConverter (part of Application Designer). It operates similarly to ODK Collect, but is based on HTML, CSS, and Javascript rather than native Android, and is more flexible in its presentation and execution.

## [ODK-X Services](#odk-x-services)
An Android app that handles database access, file access, and data synchronization services between all the ODK-X applications. Mostly this happens behind the scenes, but you will need to install ODK-X Services as a prerequisite to using the other ODK-X tools. It also allows you to sync data collected by the ODK-X tools with an ODK-X Cloud Endpoint.
